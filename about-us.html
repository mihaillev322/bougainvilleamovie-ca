<h1>About Us: US-First Research and Clear Editorial Standards</h1>

<section id="mission" class="content-section">
<h2>Mission and scope</h2>
<p>This resource hub exists to serve readers in the United States who need reliable, well-organized information on niche topics that affect personal decisions, professional development, and organizational planning. Our mission centers on making specialized knowledge accessible without sacrificing accuracy or nuance, recognizing that most people benefit from clear explanations rather than technical documentation alone.</p>
<p>We created this platform after observing a persistent gap between authoritative sources and practical understanding. Government agencies, academic institutions, and professional organizations publish extensive documentation, but navigating these resources requires familiarity with bureaucratic structures and technical vocabulary that many readers lack. Our role is to bridge that gap by synthesizing information from credible sources into formats designed for efficient comprehension.</p>
<p>The scope of this hub focuses specifically on topics relevant to the United States context, acknowledging the unique regulatory environment, institutional structures, and cultural considerations that shape how Americans interact with various systems and processes. While some principles may apply broadly, we prioritize accuracy for US readers over universal applicability.</p>
<p>What we cover includes foundational concepts, typical benchmarks, common questions, and frameworks for evaluation. We explain terminology, outline processes, and provide context for understanding official guidance. What we explicitly avoid includes personalized advice, specific recommendations for individual circumstances, and claims that require professional judgment to validate. This distinction protects readers from acting on general information as though it were tailored counsel.</p>
<p>Our content draws from sources including federal agencies, established research institutions, and recognized standards organizations. The <a href="https://www.loc.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Library of Congress</a> serves as a model for comprehensive information stewardship, while accountability frameworks from the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> inform our approach to verifying claims and documenting sources.</p>
<p>We encourage readers to treat this hub as a starting point rather than a final destination. After developing foundational understanding here, proceed to primary sources for current requirements, consult qualified professionals for personalized guidance, and verify time-sensitive information directly with relevant authorities. Our goal is to make those subsequent steps more productive by ensuring you arrive with appropriate context and vocabulary.</p>
<p>For practical application of the concepts discussed throughout this site, <a href="/">visit the hub</a> homepage for benchmarks and quick comparisons, or explore the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ section</a> for answers to common questions organized by theme.</p>

<h2>Research workflow</h2>
<p>Our editorial process follows a structured workflow designed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and appropriate attribution across all content. Each piece of information published on this hub passes through multiple stages of verification and review before reaching readers.</p>

<p>Our sourcing hierarchy prioritizes government sources (.gov domains) and educational institutions (.edu domains) as primary references, followed by established non-profit organizations (.org domains) with demonstrated expertise and transparent governance. Commercial sources are used sparingly and only when they provide unique data not available elsewhere, with clear disclosure of their nature.</p>
<p>Corrections are handled transparently. When we identify errors in published content, we update the material promptly and note significant changes. Minor clarifications may be made without annotation, but substantive corrections that affect reader understanding or decisions are documented with revision dates.</p>
<p>The concept of research integrity that guides our work aligns with principles documented by institutions focused on knowledge organization and dissemination. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Research methodology</a> as a discipline provides frameworks for systematic inquiry that inform our approach to gathering and presenting information responsibly.</p>

<h2>Accessibility and performance standards</h2>
<p>We build this hub with accessibility and performance as foundational requirements rather than afterthoughts. Every design and development decision considers the diverse ways readers access and interact with web content, including those using assistive technologies, those with limited bandwidth, and those who prefer keyboard navigation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our technical standard: This site uses no JavaScript, relies entirely on semantic HTML for structure and meaning, prioritizes keyboard-first navigation patterns, supports reduced-motion preferences, and delivers fast-loading CSS without external dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Accessibility commitments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semantic HTML structure:</strong> All content uses appropriate HTML5 elements that convey meaning to assistive technologies, including proper heading hierarchy, landmark regions, and descriptive link text.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard navigation:</strong> Every interactive element is accessible via keyboard, with visible focus indicators that meet contrast requirements and logical tab order throughout all pages.</li>
<li><strong>Color and contrast:</strong> Text and interactive elements maintain sufficient contrast ratios against backgrounds, and information is never conveyed through color alone.</li>
<li><strong>Motion sensitivity:</strong> Users who prefer reduced motion through their system settings experience a site without transitions or animations that could cause discomfort.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> Content adapts to various screen sizes and orientations without loss of functionality or requiring horizontal scrolling for text content.</li>
<li><strong>No JavaScript dependency:</strong> All content and navigation functions without client-side scripting, ensuring compatibility with security-restricted environments and older devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>These commitments align with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium. For comprehensive guidance on web accessibility standards, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative</a> provides authoritative documentation on making web content perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users.</p>
<p>Performance optimization complements accessibility by ensuring that pages load quickly regardless of connection speed or device capability. Our approach minimizes file sizes, avoids external resource dependencies, and structures content for progressive rendering so readers can begin consuming information before all assets finish loading.</p>
